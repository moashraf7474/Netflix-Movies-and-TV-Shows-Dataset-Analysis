📊 Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset
. The dataset contains information such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and type (Movie or TV Show).

🚀 Project Workflow
🔹 1. Data Cleaning

Checked and handled missing values (fillna, dropna).

Replaced nulls in categorical columns with placeholders like “Unknown” or “Not available”.

Removed duplicate records for consistency.

Stripped unnecessary spaces in column names.

🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Movies vs TV Shows → Count plot comparison.

Top 10 Countries → Bar chart of most content-producing countries.

Ratings Distribution → Visualization of content ratings (TV-MA, PG, R, etc.).

Duration Analysis → Comparison of movie runtimes and TV show seasons.

🔹 3. Visualization

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

Count plots

Bar charts

Histograms
These visualizations made it easier to understand Netflix’s content trends.
